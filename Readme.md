## CipherSentry
CipherSentry is a machine learning-powered web app built with Streamlit. It provides fraud URL detection and credit card transaction analysis to enhance cybersecurity.

<a name= "Introduction0"></a>
## What is Machine Learning 
Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to "learn" from data, without being explicitly programmed. In CipherSentry, machine learning algorithms are used to analyze patterns in credit card transactions and identify potentially fraudulent activity.

<a name = "Streamlit"></a>
## What is Streamlit
Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create interactive web apps and data visualizations. CipherSentry uses Streamlit to create a user-friendly interface for users to input and analyze data related to credit card transactions and cybersecurity.

## Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and sensitive information from unauthorized access, theft, or damage. In the digital age, cybersecurity is essential to protect against cyber attacks, data breaches, and other forms of cybercrime. CipherSentry helps enhance cybersecurity by providing fraud URL detection and credit card transaction analysis.

## Fraud URL Detection
Fraudulent URLs are links to websites that are designed to deceive users and steal their personal or financial information. CipherSentry uses machine learning algorithms to analyze URLs and identify potential fraud, helping users avoid malicious websites and protect their sensitive information.

<a name="Introduction2"></a>
## Fraud Credit Card Transaction Detection
Credit card transaction analysis involves using machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and anomalies in credit card transactions. CipherSentry uses these algorithms to identify potentially fraudulent activity and alert users to suspicious transactions, helping to prevent financial fraud and theft.
